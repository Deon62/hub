    {
        id: 'your-business-id',
        name: 'Your Business Name',
        category: 'services', // or 'goods', 'food', 'fashion', 'beauty', 'tutoring'
        type: 'service', // or 'goods'
        description: 'Your business description...',
        contactMethod: 'whatsapp', // or 'phone', 'email'
        contactInfo: '+254712345678',
        instagram: 'https://instagram.com/yourhandle',
        location: 'Your location',
        tags: ['budget', 'delivery'],
        image: null,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
    // Add more businesses here...
];
```

### Changing Colors
Modify the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

    --muted: #6B7280;      /* Muted grey */
}
```
