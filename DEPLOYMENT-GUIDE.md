# 🚀 BSN Mobile Update Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Make Your Changes
Edit your BSN files (app.js, styles.css, HTML files, etc.)

### 2. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update BSN with new features"
git push
```

### 3. Vercel Auto-Deploys
- Vercel automatically detects the push
- Deploys your changes within 1-2 minutes
- Users get updates on their phones within 15 seconds

## 📱 How Mobile Updates Work

### Smart Update System
- **First 2 minutes**: Updates happen silently (no interruption)
- **After 2 minutes**: Shows a friendly update banner (not nagging)
- **Update banner**: Auto-dismisses after 10 seconds
- **If dismissed**: Updates silently in background after 5 seconds
- **No spam**: Won't show update prompt again for 1 hour

### Update Banner Features
- ✅ Beautiful, non-intrusive design
- ✅ "Update" and "Later" buttons
- ✅ Auto-dismisses if ignored
- ✅ Mobile-optimized layout
- ✅ Matches your BSN theme colors

## 🧪 Testing Updates

### On Your Phone:
1. Open your BSN app
2. Make a small change (like adding text to a page)
3. Push to GitHub
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Refresh your phone app - you should see the update banner

### Update Banner Behavior:
- **Shows after**: 2+ minutes of app usage
- **Auto-dismisses**: After 10 seconds
- **Won't show again**: For 1 hour after dismissal
- **Always updates**: Even if dismissed (silently in background)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Update Check Frequency
- **Service Worker**: Checks every 15 seconds
- **App Focus**: Checks when user returns to app
- **Page Load**: Checks on every page load

### Smart Update Logic
```javascript
// Shows update banner if:
// 1. User has been using app for 2+ minutes
// 2. Haven't shown update prompt in last hour
// 3. New version is available
```
